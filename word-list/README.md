program  in   the  main  directory   works  as  a   "Word  Mastermind"
codebreaker.

Stanford Graphbase
==================

The [Stanford Graphbase](https://github.com/ascherer/sgb)
project provides a list of 5757 English words, all 5-letter long. This
file, as all the files in this  project, is in the public domain, with
a copyright (c) 1993 Stanford University. It can be downloaded with

```
curl -o sgb-words.txt https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb-words.txt
```

or with

```
wget https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb-words.txt
```

The [version](https://github.com/ascherer/sgb/blob/master/words.dat)
available  in the  Github  repository is  not  convenient, because  it
includes several  technical additions and a  few administrative lines.
The  copyright notice  can  be found  in this  file.  The author  also
explains that copying the file is allowed, but not modifying it.
