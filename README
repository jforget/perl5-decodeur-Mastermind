This  repository  hosts  a  Mastermind solver  program.   The  program
attempts to use a reasonable number  of turns to solve the problem. It
does not attempt to execute a complete search of the game tree to find
the optimum strategy, it just uses some heuristics.

The  program should  scale beyond  the usual  6-color  4-hole standard
game. It  can deal with the  variants with rules similar  to the basic
rules. It cannot deal with  rules variants, such as "Grand Mastermind"
(with colors and shapes), 4-player mastermind and the like.

This script is licensed under the same terms as perl.
